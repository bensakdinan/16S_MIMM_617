# 16S_MIMM_617
16S ecology project for MIMM 617 (The Human Microbiome at McGill University), taught by Anshul Sinha, PhD.

The workflow in this repository was designed by Anshul Sinha, PhD, research assistant at McGill University, Maurice and Shapiro Labs. The original protocol designed by Anshul can be accessed here: https://anshulsinha1.github.io/617_16S_Tutorial/walkthrough/ 

This repository is to showcase my own practice of his workflow and to highlight any personal comments/changes I made.
